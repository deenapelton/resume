<p>I'm an artist. I've loved art since I was a child. 
  You could always find me painting, but as I grew older I put the brush 
  down and started focusing on my studies. Years were passing me by and I forgot
  about how much I loved art. I was becoming increasingly aggitated and unhappy in the 
  work place and my life.
</p>

<p>All this was about to change after I had my last child. She was such a good 
  baby and took long naps. That's when I decided to pick up my paint brush and start
  painting again. After a week of painting, I soon realized this was the happiest I've been
  in a long time. That's when I decided to make painting my life, and hense
  Brush It Up Mobile Paint Parties was born!

<p>I love what I do. My business will be 5 years old in July! Now that my business
  is doing well, I decided that I will learn how to code. When building my business,
  I found a new love of technology! Now I will still be painting but learning to code as well.
